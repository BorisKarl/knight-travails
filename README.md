# knight-travails

This is the answert to the project "Knight Travails" in the odin project JavaScript curriculum.
It outputs the shortest way for the knight in a game of chess from one position to the other.
It uses an array of Nodes to deal with every possibillity to move from field to field.
Then it checks, if the field was already visited or not until it reaches the field of destination.
Knight Travails took me more time that I actually imagined, much much more;)
